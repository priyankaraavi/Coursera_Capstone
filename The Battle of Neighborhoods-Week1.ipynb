    "### A bookstore is a place where different kinds of textbooks or reference books are sold. It is a very important place for all educated persons. Most of the customers of the bookstore are book lovers of all ages. It is mostly familiar to the students. In a bookstore, there are different shelves which are nicely arranged. From a book shop, we can buy our textbooks, story books, novels, dictionaries, science fiction books etc. In fact, a bookstore always plays an important role for the readers and mostly the students. There are many bookstores in the city of New York. Serious considerations are required to open a new bookstore than it seems. So the location of the bookstore is one of the most important decisions that will determine whether the bookstore will be a successful investment or failure."
